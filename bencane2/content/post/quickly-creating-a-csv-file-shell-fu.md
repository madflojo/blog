title: Quickly creating a CSV file
url: /2011/07/19/quickly-creating-a-csv-file-shell-fu

---

I have found that a systems administrators job doesn't simply involve managing services and ensuring they are running. Many times the job includes extracting data from files and putting them into a usable form.

Today's example of Shell-Fu is creating a CSV list of the users on the system generated by the /etc/passwd file.

    [bcane@bcane play]$ cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1| perl -pi -e 's/n/,/'  
    root,bin,daemon,adm,lp,sync,shutdown,halt,mail,uucp,operator,games,[Continued]

If you wanted to save this to a file you could use `>` or  depending on whether you want to overwrite pre-existing data or not.

`>` Will overwrite an existing file  
`>>` Will append to an existing file
