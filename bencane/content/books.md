This book was created as a guide to help Sysadmins, DevOps, or anyone working on Linux troubleshoot and solve common problems. This book's readers have used it to prepare for the Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) and Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) certification exams. The focus on real-world challenges and teaching the reader how to identify issues helps bridge the gap between knowing what something is versus how it works.

### Reader Reviews:

> This guide is awesome, it is precise when needed and also gives perspective with general explanation when needed. Obviously the Author draws from his own experience but principles and solutions are applicable to any Red Hat Linux setting. Absolutely recommended for those working with Linux on a daily basis as well as for the aspiring admin. I'm also using this book as a resource to prepare for Red Hat's CoE Diagnosing and Troubleshooting RHEL 7. -- Amazon Reader Review
